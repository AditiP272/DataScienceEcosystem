# ### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python:

# In[4]:


#  This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers
out=(3*4)+5
print(out)


# In[5]:


# This will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 60
minutes = 200
hours = minutes / 60

print(hours)
